Hello, my main job is front-end development engineer, mainly engaged in front-end development content. So the commonly used language is **JS (TS)**, and on top of this, I will use frameworks such as **Vue** and **React**. However, due to their lack of SEO friendliness, I will also use Nuxt and Next. I call this the backend of the front-end. Although my main business is front-end development, in my spare time, I also study other languages such as Golang, Rust, and other development technologies such as Three.js, which enable me to develop 3D scenes. So I feel more like a web development programmer, all related to the web
