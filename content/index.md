Hello, if you can find this, it means we are destined to meet.

### About Me

I am primarily a frontend developer with a focus on web technologies. However, that doesn't stop me from having an interest in other technologies. Due to certain requirements, I also have knowledge in other tech stacks such as go, java, rust, docker, mysql, and electron. Among them, go and rust are the ones that interest me the most outside of web development.

Especially, rust has great potential in the web toolchain. For example, there is a Rust alternative to webpack called [Rspack](https://www.rspack.dev), and in 2023, it was announced at the vite conference that vite will also be rewritten in rust. Additionally, rust has great potential in the wasm field. Therefore, I believe that to excel in frontend technologies and have a broader range of solutions, mastering rust is essential.

### About Frontend

I have been working in frontend development for about four to five years, or maybe even longer, I can't recall exactly. The main languages I use are javascript and its superset typescript. I am familiar with frameworks and libraries such as vue, vue-router, and pinia within the Vue ecosystem. In terms of bundlers, I primarily use vite, esbuild, and rollup, but I am also proficient in webpack. I can also work with React, although my understanding of it is not as deep as Vue. However, this difference is mainly because I have read through the source code of Vue, whereas I have only a basic understanding of the internal workings of React. Nonetheless, if I need to work with React for a project, it doesn't pose a problem. React is also one of the technologies I plan to focus on in the future.

Apart from working in the browser, I also have a good understanding of electron. I have developed a scaffold for creating electron apps called [create-electron-app](https://assist-electron.netlify.app/) using esbuild and vite. It supports hot-reloading in the main thread and seamlessly integrates with vite and related plugins. However, there are still some limitations as it was initially developed for the convenience of my company's projects.

Also, as you can see, this website is built with nuxt, and I am capable of working with nuxt and next, which are frameworks for server-side rendering (SSR).

### About Backend

As mentioned earlier, I also have experience with golang and java, although my exposure to java is not as extensive as golang. The backend technology I have used most frequently is the combination of gin and grom. I have also studied the source code of gin-vue-admin and learned many useful techniques from that project. I quite like the Go language because it was the first strongly typed language I encountered. It has a simple syntax and is easy to pick up. However, in the ever-evolving tech world, one cannot neglect Java. I am actively learning Java as well, although I wonder if I am a bit late to the game.

### Learning Approach

My approach to learning technology is driven by practical needs and efficiency. For technologies that I am unfamiliar with or have limited knowledge of in my work, I dedicate my spare time to quickly mastering them. I also take the opportunity to explore their source code. For example, when I wanted to improve the efficiency of developing electron apps, I developed [create-electron-app](https://assist-electron.netlify.app/) and studied the source code of vite. I specifically learned how to use esbuild and rollup to compare which one is more suitable as a bundling tool for the main thread. This process has allowed me to acquire a wide range of skills in the field of building and has made me proficient in using vite. Additionally, I have learned some coding techniques from examining the vite source code.

If you are also someone who wants to learn web or other technologies, feel free to contact me. We can exchange knowledge. After all, the wisdom of three people is greater than that of a single individual!
