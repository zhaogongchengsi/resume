Hello, if you can find this, it means we are destined to meet.

### About Me

I am primarily a frontend developer with a focus on web technologies. However, that doesn't stop me from having an interest in other technologies. Due to certain requirements, I also have knowledge in other tech stacks such as `golang`, `java`, `rust`, `docker`, `mysql`, and `electron`. Among them, `go` and `rust` are the ones that interest me the most outside of web development.

Especially, rust has great potential in the web toolchain. For example, there is a Rust alternative to webpack called [Rspack](https://www.rspack.dev), and in 2023, it was announced at the `vite` conference that `vite` will also be rewritten in rust. Additionally, `rust` has great potential in the wasm field. Therefore, I believe that to excel in frontend technologies and have a broader range of solutions, mastering rust is essential.
